        the little victories, the everyday wins that pave the way for bigger
        achievements.

        Think of it like this: Imagine yourself scaling a seemingly
        insurmountable mountain. The peak may seem distant and the climb
        daunting. But with each small step you take, each mini victory of
        reaching a new ledge or clearing a tricky path, you get closer to the
        summit. This book is your guide, cheering you on as you conquer those
        mini challenges, celebrating your MiniWins in your personal growth,
        professional endeavors, and even your love life.

        This book wouldn't exist without the unwavering support and inspiration
        of my incredible wife, Mini. Her unending belief in me has been the wind
        beneath my wings, propelling me forward even when doubt threatened to
        cloud my vision. She has a unique ability to see the best in me, drawing
        out the version of myself I strive to be. Mini, thank you for your love,
        understanding, and unwavering support. You are my wife, my confidante,
        my friend, and my family, all rolled into one. This journey wouldn't
        have been possible without you.
