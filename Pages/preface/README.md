# Book Excerpt w/ Responsive Columns #cpc

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/melipi/pen/LYjwyyb](https://codepen.io/melipi/pen/LYjwyyb).

I've been sick and I feel bad that I hadn't been able to update this pen's description for so long!

Here goes~

1. I kept it simple and just wanted to set a width and amount for the columns using the  [`columns` shorthand property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/columns).

2. The flower silhouette is from [FreeSVG](https://freesvg.org/linseed-silhouette) and I just used the png version.

3. I used the [`shape-outside` property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/shape-outside) for the text to flow around the first paragraph of the text. 

4. For the typography, I read up on [drop caps](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/drop-caps/) and used the beautiful flowery font [Fleur De Leah](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fleur+De+Leah) for that first letter of the excerpt. The rest of the text on the page was just different `font-weights` and sizes of the [Spectral font family](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Spectral) which I thought fit the excerpt of the story nicely.

That's all for my notes this time around. Thanks for stopping by :)
